# Docker Pure-ftpd Server

Pull down with docker:

```bash
docker pull ivonet/ftp
```

## Starting it 

`docker run -d --name ftpd_server -p 21:21 -p 30000-30009:30000-30009 -e "PUBLICHOST=localhost" ivonet/ftp`

*Or for your own image, replace ivonet/ftp with the name you built it with, e.g. my-pure-ftp*

You can also pass ADDED_FLAGS as an env variable to add additional options such as --tls to the pure-ftpd command.  
e.g. ` -e "ADDED_FLAGS=--tls=2" `


## Operating it

`docker exec -it ftpd_server /bin/bash`

## Example usage once inside

Create an ftp user: `e.g. bob with chroot access only to /home/ftpusers/bob`
```bash
pure-pw useradd bob -f /etc/pure-ftpd/passwd/pureftpd.passwd -m -u ftpuser -d /home/ftpusers/bob
```
*No restart should be needed.*

More info on usage here: https://download.pureftpd.org/pure-ftpd/doc/README.Virtual-Users


## Test your connection

From the host machine:
```bash
ftp -p localhost 11021
```

## Logs

To get verbose logs add the following to your `docker run` command:
```
-e "ADDED_FLAGS=-d -d"
```

Then if you exec into the container you could watch over the log with `tail -f /var/log/messages`

Want a transfer log file? add the following to your `docker run` command:
```bash
-e "ADDED_FLAGS=-O w3c:/var/log/pure-ftpd/transfer.log"
```


## Our default pure-ftpd options explained

```
/usr/sbin/pure-ftpd # path to pure-ftpd executable
-c 50 # --maxclientsnumber (no more than 50 people at once)
-C 10 # --maxclientsperip (no more than 10 requests from the same ip)
-l puredb:/etc/pure-ftpd/pureftpd.pdb # --login (login file for virtual users)
-E # --noanonymous (only real users)
-j # --createhomedir (auto create home directory if it doesnt already exist)
-R # --nochmod (prevent usage of the CHMOD command)
-P $PUBLICHOST # IP/Host setting for PASV support, passed in your the PUBLICHOST env var
-p 30000:30009 # PASV port range
-tls 1 # Enables optional TLS support
```

For more information please see `man pure-ftpd`, or visit: https://www.pureftpd.org/

## Why so many ports opened?

This is for PASV support 

## Docker Volumes

There are a few spots onto which you can mount a docker volume to configure the
server and persist uploaded data. It's recommended to use them in production. 

  - `/home/ftpusers/` The ftp's data volume (by convention). 
  - `/etc/pure-ftpd/passwd` A directory containing the single `pureftps.passwd`
    file which contains the user database (i.e., all virtual users, their
    passwords and their home directories). This is read on startup of the
    container and updated by the `pure-pw useradd -f /etc/pure-
    ftpd/passwd/pureftpd.passwd ...` command.
  - `/etc/ssl/private/` A directory containing a single `pure-ftpd.pem` file
    with the server's SSL certificates for TLS support. Optional TLS is
    automatically enabled when the container finds this file on startup.

## Keep user database in a volume

You may want to keep your user database through the successive image builds. It is possible with Docker volumes.

Create a named volume:
```
docker volume create --name my-db-volume
```

Specify it when running the container:
```
docker run -d --name ftpd_server -p 21:21 -p 30000-30009:30000-30009 -e "PUBLICHOST=localhost" -v my-db-volume:/etc/pure-ftpd/passwd ivonet/ftp
```

When an user is added, you need to use the password file which is in the volume:
```
pure-pw useradd bob -f /etc/pure-ftpd/passwd/pureftpd.passwd -m -u ftpuser -d /home/ftpusers/bob
```
(Thanks to the -m option, you don't need to call *pure-pw mkdb* with this syntax).


## TLS

If you want to enable tls (for ftps connections), you need to have a valid
certificate. You can get one from one of the certificate authorities that you'll
find when googling this topic. The certificate (containing private key and
certificate) needs to be at:

```
/etc/ssl/private/pure-ftpd.pem
```

Use docker volumes to get the certificate there at runtime. The container will
automatically enable optional TLS when it detect the file at this location.

You can also self-sign a certificate, which is certainly the easiest way to
start out. Self signed certificates come with certain drawbacks, but it might
be better to have a self signed one than none at all.

Here's how to create a self-signed certificate from within the container:

```bash
mkdir -p /etc/ssl/private
openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/private/pure-ftpd-dhparams.pem 2048
openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -keyout \
    /etc/ssl/private/pure-ftpd.pem \
    -out /etc/ssl/private/pure-ftpd.pem
chmod 600 /etc/ssl/private/*.pem
```
